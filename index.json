In this pipeline, the performance of the BSS algorithm, which is defined as its ability to separate properly the independent sources (like the EEG from artifactual sources), is very crucial for rejecting most of the artifacts, while maintaining the most part of EEG intact. The overwhelming majority of the published papers uses the extended INFOMAX version of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for artifact rejection purposes. But is this the most efficient algorithm to separate EEG signals into independent components? This study comes to shed light to the aforementioned question by assessing the performance of the five most common BSS algorithms. The normalized entropy of the brain-related components, their correlation between independent components with the original sources and the amount of the overall mutual information reduction (MIR) achieved by each decomposition were computed in datasets with systematically varying numbers of electrodes (ranging from 19 tο 99), from 26 real human scalp EEG recordings. Additionally, 54 different datasets containing artificially contaminated EEG signals were also examined for the same purpose, on the basis of the Euclidean distance and the correlation, between the generated Independent Components (ICs) and the original vertical and horizontal eye signals, which were used for the contamination. The results support that the Adaptive Mixture ICA was the best performing BSS method.","tags":["EEG","BSS","ICA","Signal processing","EEG decomposition"],"title":"Which BSS method separates better the EEG Signals?

Using fMRI experience-sampling we show that MB is reported scarcely, fast, and has low transitional dynamics, pointing to its role as a transient mental relay. MB’s cerebral profile is linked to an overall positive connectivity pattern, bearing great resemblance to neural configurations observed in local sleeps, possibly reflecting neuronal silencing during wakefulness. We also find less efficient information flow between the default mode (DMN) and other networks before reporting MB. The DMN-salience network segregation was further able to classify MB from other reports in fewer steps, suggestive of an early saliency evaluation of contentless phenomenology along the neurocognitive hierarchy. Collectively, MB’s unique neurofunctional profile among thought-oriented reports supports the view of instantaneous mental absences happening during wakefuless, paving the way for more mechanistic investigations of this particular phenomenology during ongoing mentation.","tags":["Mind Blanking","fMRI","Connectivity","DMN","wakefulness"],"title":"Mind blanking is associated with a rigid spatio-temporal profile in typical wakefulness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra Anagnostopoulou","Charis Styliadis","Panagiotis Kartsidis","Evangelia Romanopoulou","Vasiliki Zilidou","Chrysi Karali","Maria Karagianni","Manousos Klados","Evangelos Paraskevopoulos","Panagiotis D Bamidis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"58994e4e475ff1e17aacfed4831c680a","permalink":"https://ramsys28.github.io/publication/anagnostopoulou2021/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anagnostopoulou2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding the neuroplastic capacity of people with Down syndrome (PwDS) can potentially reveal the causal relationship between aberrant brain organization and phenotypic characteristics. We used resting-state EEG recordings to identify how a neuroplasticity-triggering training protocol relates to changes in the functional connectivity of the brain’s intrinsic cortical networks. Brain activity of 12 PwDS before and after a 10-week protocol of combined physical and cognitive training was statistically compared to quantify changes in directed functional connectivity in conjunction with psychosomatometric assessments. PwDS showed increased connectivity within the left hemisphere and from left-to-right hemisphere, as well as increased physical and cognitive performance. Our findings reveal a strong adaptive neuroplastic reorganization as a result of the training that leads to a less-random network with a more pronounced hierarchical organization. Our results go beyond previous findings by indicating a transition to a healthier, more efficient, and flexible network architecture, with improved integration and segregation abilities in the brain of PwDS.

Despite the numerous reports on the neuroplastic role of physical exercise in patients with PD (PwPD), its effects have not been thoroughly explored via brain network science, which can provide a coherent framework for understanding brain functioning. We used resting-state EEG data to investigate the functional connectivity changes of the brain’s intrinsic cortical networks due to physical exercise. The brain activity of 14 PwPD before and after a ten-week protocol of computerized physical training was statistically compared to quantify changes in directed functional connectivity in conjunction with psychometric and somatometric assessments. PwPD showed a significant reorganization of the post-training brain network along with increases in their physical capacity. Specifically, our results revealed significant adjustments in clustering, increased characteristic path length, and decreased global efficiency, in correlation to the improved physical capacity. Our results go beyond previous findings by indicating a transition to a reparative network architecture of enhanced connectivity. We present a meaningful relationship between network characteristics and motor execution capacity which support the use of motor treatment in tandem with medication. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT04426903. Impact Statement The effects of physical training (PT) on the neuroplasticity attributes of patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PwPD) have been well documented via neurophysiological evaluations. However, there is a knowledge gap on the role of training-induced neuroplasticity in whole-brain network organization. We investigated the PT effects on the brain network organization of 14 PwPD, using EEG and network indices coupled with psychosomatometric tests. We report evidence of reparative functional reorganization of the brain with more balanced integration and segregation abilities, in correlation to improved motor performance. The PD brain can repair and reestablish a better level of motor execution and control due to computer-empowered physical stimulation.","tags":["Parkinson’s disease (PD)","Physical training","Cognitive training","EEG","Connectivity"],"title":"Computerized physical exercise improves the functional architecture of the brain in patients with Parkinsons Disease a network science resting-state EEG study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolina Sciaraffa","Manousos Klados","Gianluca Borghini","Gianluca Di Flumeri","Fabio Babiloni","Pietro Aricò"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582156800,"objectID":"63abb33f6c1c209946a720826000e75f","permalink":"https://ramsys28.github.io/publication/sciaraffa2021/","publishdate":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sciaraffa2021/","section":"publication","summary":"The need for automatic detection and classification of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) as biomarkers of the epileptogenic tissue is strongly felt in the clinical field. In this context, the employment of artificial intelligence methods could be the missing piece to achieve this goal. This work proposed a double-step procedure based on machine learning algorithms and tested it on an intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) dataset available online. The first step aimed to define the optimal length for signal segmentation, allowing for an optimal discrimination of segments with HFO relative to those without. In this case, binary classifiers have been tested on a set of energy features. The second step aimed to classify these segments into ripples, fast ripples and fast ripples occurring during ripples. Results suggest that LDA applied to 10 ms segmentation could provide the highest sensitivity (0.874) and 0.776 specificity for the discrimination of HFOs from no-HFO segments. Regarding the three-class classification, non-linear methods provided the highest values (around 90%) in terms of specificity and sensitivity, significantly different to the other three employed algorithms. Therefore, this machine-learning-based procedure could help clinicians to automatically reduce the quantity of irrelevant data.","tags":["HFOs","epilepsy","iEEG","machine learning"],"title":"Double-Step Machine Learning Based Procedure for HFOs Detection and Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
