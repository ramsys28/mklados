  abstract    = "AbstractPhysical exercise is an effective non-pharmaceutical
                 treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms, both motor
                 and non-motor. Despite the numerous reports on the
                 neuroplastic role of physical exercise in patients with PD
                 (PwPD), its effects have not been thoroughly explored via
                 brain network science, which can provide a coherent framework
                 for understanding brain functioning. We used resting-state EEG
                 data to investigate the functional connectivity changes of the
                 brain's intrinsic cortical networks due to physical exercise.
                 The brain activity of 14 PwPD before and after a ten-week
                 protocol of computerized physical training was statistically
                 compared to quantify changes in directed functional
                 connectivity in conjunction with psychometric and somatometric
                 assessments. PwPD showed a significant reorganization of the
                 post-training brain network along with increases in their
                 physical capacity. Specifically, our results revealed
                 significant adjustments in clustering, increased
                 characteristic path length, and decreased global efficiency,
                 in correlation to the improved physical capacity. Our results
                 go beyond previous findings by indicating a transition to a
                 reparative network architecture of enhanced connectivity. We
                 present a meaningful relationship between network
                 characteristics and motor execution capacity which support the
                 use of motor treatment in tandem with medication. This trial
                 is registered
                 withClinicalTrials.govIdentifierNCT04426903.Impact
                 StatementThe effects of physical training (PT) on the
                 neuroplasticity attributes of patients with Parkinson's
                 Disease (PwPD) have been well documented via
                 neurophysiological evaluations. However, there is a knowledge
                 gap on the role of training-induced neuroplasticity in
                 whole-brain network organization. We investigated the PT
                 effects on the brain network organization of 14 PwPD, using
                 EEG and network indices coupled with psychosomatometric tests.
                 We report evidence of reparative functional reorganization of
                 the brain with more balanced integration and segregation
                 abilities, in correlation to improved motor performance. The
                 PD brain can repair and reestablish a better level of motor
                 execution and control due to computer-empowered physical
                 stimulation.",
