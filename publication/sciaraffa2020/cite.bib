  abstract  = "The need for automatic detection and classification of
               high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) as biomarkers of the
               epileptogenic tissue is strongly felt in the clinical field. In
               this context, the employment of artificial intelligence methods
               could be the missing piece to achieve this goal. This work
               proposed a double-step procedure based on machine learning
               algorithms and tested it on an intracranial electroencephalogram
               (iEEG) dataset available online. The first step aimed to define
               the optimal length for signal segmentation, allowing for an
               optimal discrimination of segments with HFO relative to those
               without. In this case, binary classifiers have been tested on a
               set of energy features. The second step aimed to classify these
               segments into ripples, fast ripples and fast ripples occurring
               during ripples. Results suggest that LDA applied to 10 ms
               segmentation could provide the highest sensitivity (0.874) and
               0.776 specificity for the discrimination of HFOs from no-HFO
               segments. Regarding the three-class classification, non-linear
               methods provided the highest values (around 90\%) in terms of
               specificity and sensitivity, significantly different to the
               other three employed algorithms. Therefore, this
               machine-learning-based procedure could help clinicians to
               automatically reduce the quantity of irrelevant data.",
