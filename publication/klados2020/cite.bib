  abstract  = "Personality is the characteristic set of an individual's
               behavioral and emotional patterns that evolve from biological
               and environmental factors. The recognition of personality
               profiles is crucial in making human-computer interaction (HCI)
               applications realistic, more focused, and user friendly. The
               ability to recognize personality using neuroscientific data
               underpins the neurobiological basis of personality. This paper
               aims to automatically recognize personality, combining scalp
               electroencephalogram (EEG) and machine learning techniques. As
               the resting state EEG has not so far been proven efficient for
               predicting personality, we used EEG recordings elicited during
               emotion processing. This study was based on data from the AMIGOS
               dataset reflecting the response of 37 healthy participants.
               Brain networks and graph theoretical parameters were extracted
               from cleaned EEG signals, while each trait score was
               dichotomized into low- and high-level using the k-means
               algorithm. A feature selection algorithm was used afterwards to
               reduce the feature-set size to the best 10 features to describe
               each trait separately. Support vector machines (SVM) were
               finally employed to classify each instance. Our method achieved
               a classification accuracy of 83.8\% for extraversion, 86.5\% for
               agreeableness, 83.8\% for conscientiousness, 83.8\% for
               neuroticism, and 73\% for openness.",
