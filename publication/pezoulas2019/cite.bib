  abstract  = "The human cerebellum contains almost 50\% of the neurons in the
               brain, although its volume does not exceed 10\% of the total
               brain volume. The goal of this study is to derive the functional
               network of the cerebellum during the resting-state and then
               compare the ensuing group networks between males and females.
               Toward this direction, a spatially constrained version of the
               classic spectral clustering algorithm is proposed and then
               compared against conventional spectral graph theory approaches,
               such as spectral clustering, and N-cut, on synthetic data as
               well as on resting-state fMRI data obtained from the Human
               Connectome Project (HCP). The extracted atlas was combined with
               the anatomical atlas of the cerebellum resulting in a functional
               atlas with 46 regions of interest. As a final step, a
               gender-based network analysis of the cerebellum was performed
               using the data-driven atlas along with the concept of the
               minimum spanning trees. The simulation analysis results confirm
               the dominance of the spatially constrained spectral clustering
               approach in discriminating activation patterns under noisy
               conditions. The network analysis results reveal statistically
               significant differences in the optimal tree organization between
               males and females. In addition, the dominance of the left VI
               lobule in both genders supports the results reported in a
               previous study of ours. To our knowledge, the extracted atlas
               comprises the first resting-state atlas of the cerebellum based
               on HCP data.",
